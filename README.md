Land-Registery-And-Deeding
==========================

A Stake in the Ground.



#Overview


BITNATION is an experimental form of Do-It-Yourself governance using decentralized, trustless models such as Bitcoin’s blockchain. Its key principle is that all participation is  voluntary. Meaning that there’s a community consent, and approval, timestamped in the blockchain for later reference, for every claim, and transaction.
Objective


Design BITNATION’s initial land registry and deed protocol that will be applicable for places where currently there are no functioning land registry and deeding services. Those could, for instance, be the Favelas in Brazil, or the suburbs in Ghana. It will help many countries to foster peace in their communities through resolving land disputes in a peaceful manner, and unlock wealth through securing properties. A deeded property enable people to lend money against collateral to start companies or get education, and encourages investments in the property itself.


In addition to securing their land on the blockchain, they can also refer to the LandID on other contracts, like marriage, wills, death certificates, birth certificates etc.


This is an experiment, and we would like as much community input as possible. We’re trying to use low-tech code and equipment in order to scale this in areas with scarce economic and technological resources, and knowledge. Any and all input is appreciated.


#Process for BITNATION Land Registry and Deed Pilot


The process contains three essential strands: land survey, land registry, and land deeding. However, before beginning it’s also key to understand the local context.

#1. Decide on a place

We have chosen Ghana as the place for the first pilot, because Ghana need improved land rights to bolster their autonomy and economy. We also chose Ghana because of the Dream Bitcoin Foundation in Ghana and their enthusiasm to work on this project with us. 

#2. Background research and assessment

What is the specific context -- how is the land used, what sort of contract exist, how can it be improved upon?

Resource rights and management:

*Water Rights

*Shared Wells

*Shared Sewage

*Mining Rights

*Community land: Parks, Streets, etc

*Shared Cattle

*Other shared resources

#3. Speak with the community leaders, and others

Arrange meetings with community leaders in areas suitable for tests: areas where people live in (have property) and are currently non-deeded. Speak with the community leaders to see understand their perception on the land situation, and if they’re interested in trying out the registry pilot. 
Collect information on how land contracts are managed currently, and what people like/ dislike with the system. Conduct research with open-ended questions amongst different parts of the community. 
Research local water rights, mining rights. Map out shared community resources in the pilot area: shared wells, shared sewage, shared electricity lines, etc.

#4. Come to agreement

Agree on where, when to do the pilot and who should be involved.

#5. Community workshop

A workshop with people in the area to explain the benefits of land registry and deeding, how the blockchain works in its function of a distributed public ledger, and helping people through the process of setting up their own PGP keys.

The workshop will need to be carefully prepared in advance.

#6. Decide on test area

It could be a small street or a few houses with land bordering each other, perhaps 4-5 pieces of land owned by different persons. The strategy is that people with bordering land sign off on a common map with their public keys, so that it’s verifiable that the community agreed on the boundaries, not just individual owners.

#7. Setup Survey Markers

Leave the survey markers with the community (around 30 of them, assuming there are 4-5 plots of lands to survey, and further assuming they’re not all perfectly rectangular), and spend the time it takes to agree on where the markers are set-up, defining the boundaries between the lands. 

* Survey markers should be of durable materials to keep as landmarks over time.

* Survey markers might carry a unique ID (number, sticker, RF-ID). 

Survey grade GPS equipment is expected to become increasingly cheap and accurate over the next few years ahead. The need for durable markers in the ground will therefore be of lesser importance in the future. This implies that the application of survey markers should rather be optional than mandatory.
