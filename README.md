Land-Registery-And-Deeding
==========================

#A Stake in the Ground.



##Overview


BITNATION is an experimental form of Do-It-Yourself governance using decentralized, trustless models such as Bitcoin’s blockchain. Its key principle is that all participation is  voluntary. Meaning that there’s a community consent, and approval, timestamped in the blockchain for later reference, for every claim, and transaction.
Objective


Design BITNATION’s initial land registry and deed protocol that will be applicable for places where currently there are no functioning land registry and deeding services. Those could, for instance, be the Favelas in Brazil, or the suburbs in Ghana. It will help many countries to foster peace in their communities through resolving land disputes in a peaceful manner, and unlock wealth through securing properties. A deeded property helps people to lend money to start companies or get education, and encourages investments in the property itself.


In addition to securing their land on the blockchain, they can also refer to the LandID on other contracts, like marriage, wills, death certificates, birth certificates etc.


This is an experiment, and we would like as much community input as possible. We’re trying to use low-tech code and equipment in order to scale this in areas with scarce economic and technological resources, and knowledge. Any and all input is appreciated.


Process for the BITNATION Land Registry and Deed Pilot


The process contains three essential strands: land survey, land registry, and land deeding. However, before beginning it’s also key to understand the local context.
